                    <p>Hello, I am Nathan. I don't have a career path as of now, but I want it to be something with computers.</p>
                    <p>I like to build Legos and play video games.</p>
                    <p>I already took a starter web design class back in high school, but that was around 3 years ago, so I forgot some if not most of the stuff.</p>
                    <p>I have been a member of the Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Day Saints my whole life.</p>
