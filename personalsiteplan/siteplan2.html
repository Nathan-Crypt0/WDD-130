  <div class="grid-container">
    <div class="grid-card"> <img src="images/coledragon.jpg">A nice set for small children. It comes with a nice picture story inside the manual. Needs more posability if not for kids. </div>
    <div class="grid-card"><img src="images/crystalking.jpg">A whopper of a set for a season final. Comes with a very nice build and some cool trans-purple crystallike peices and some great minifigures</div>
    <div class="grid-card"><img src="images/crystallizeddragon.jpg">The second largest ninjago dragon. Is a very beautiful color of gold along with some unique head designs and a cool wing mechanism for the wings. </div>
    <div class="grid-card"><img src="images/nyamech.jpg">A very nice mech. Needs knees and some extra covering on the shoulder area.</div>
    <div class="grid-card"><img src="images/sourcedragonmotion.jpg">The largest Ninjago dragon to date. This thing has posability everywhere a person can imagine. This whopper is streamlined and has a massive wingspan. It is strong enough to stack 4 of the other large dragons on it's back.</div>
    <div class="grid-card"><img src="images/zanesicedragon.jpg">A very good dragon. It has very cool wings and a nice color scheme. It also features spikes running down its spine.</div>
    <div class="grid-card"><img src="images/thunderfang.jpg">The biggest evil Ninjago dragon. Unlike all of the others, this one stands like a person and has the posablity of one too.</div>
    <div class="grid-card"><img src="images/jaymechdragon.jpg">Beautiful trans-neon green peices and a cool function to shoot missiles from its chest.</div>
    <div class="grid-card"><img src="images/kaimechlarge.jpg">This mech is so good that it can stand on one foot. It comes with 4 arms and a design to beat most mechs that Lego makes.</div>
